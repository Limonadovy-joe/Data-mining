## Definition
- is the process of extracting and discovering **patterns/regularities** in **large data sets** involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
- Data mining is an **interdisciplinary(mezioborovy)** subfield of **computer science and statistics** with an overall goal of extracting information from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use
- Data mining is the **analysis step of the "knowledge discovery in databases" process, or KDD**
  - Process: **KDD**
    - From a statistical perspective, **Data Mining is about finding correlations, relationships or patterns, determining trends, or predicting future developments.**
    - **Unlike the "simple" use of statistical and machine learning methods**, the KDD process **emphasizes(kladne duraz) the preparation of data for analysis and the interpretation of the resulting knowledge**. During preparation, data stored in a complex structure, such as a **data warehouse**, **is usually used to create a single table** that contains the relevant attribute values ​​of the monitored objects. During interpretation, the found knowledge is then evaluated from the perspective of the end user.
    - The knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process is commonly defined with the stages:
      - Selection
      - Pre-processing
      - Transformation
      - Data mining
      - Interpretation/evaluation
- An example of real problem is the question of finding groups of online store customers to whom a special service could be offered. The found groups are then interpreted as so-called **market segments.** 

## A Brief History of Data Mining
- Database technologies represented a means of storing and searching for information in large data sets. Statistics then represented a means of modeling and analyze dependencies of data. **At the same time, the need to use big data for strategic management of companies.**

## Business inteligence
- BI systems can also be characterized as decision support systems.
- Common **BI application functions** include **reporting, analysis support, data cubes (OLAP),** overview displays (dashboard, balanced scorecard), data mining, **enterprise performance management (CPM)**, planning support, and predictive analytics.
- ERP systems usually store their data in **relational databases, which makes the data quickly accessible, but these systems are more focused on transactional tasks.**  These are good primarily for **processing and updating data**, and possibly also for creating documents, but they only provide us with access to individual detailed data.
  - However, when solving business analyses, we need to evaluate the monitored business indicators and then analyze them from various perspectives
  - For this, we use BI, which, **as a purely analytical tool, does not create any new data, but draws(cerpa) on data created by transactional applications** and transforms it according to its needs.
- **Main BI components**:
  - Production (source) databases – described above, and the problems associated with them
  - **ETL (Extract, Transform and Load)**
  - Temporary data store (DSA)
  - Operational data store (ODS)
  - **Data warehouse (DWH)**
  - **Data mart (DMA)**
  - **OLAP databases**
  - Reporting
  - Analytical applications
  - Data mining
